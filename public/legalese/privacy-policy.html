    <main>

<p>
This Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to all products, services, and content offered by Plastic Past LLC, DBA Wikistreets ("Wikistreets", "we", "us", "our", and our subsidiaries, affiliates, or holding company). When handling your information, Wikistreets may be acting as both a Controller and a Processor as those terms are defined under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). 
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
Wikistreets takes user privacy seriously. This Policy describes how we handle information collected in relation to access and use of wikistreets.io (the "Site") and related products and services (collectively, the "Service"). When you access or use the Service, you are deemed to consent to the collection, use, retention, transfer, structuring, manipulation, storage, transmission and/or disclosure (collectively, "processing") of your information as described in this Policy and in accordance with applicable laws. 
</p>

<p>
This Policy does not govern what our users do on their own maps (i.e. custom pages that people make using the Service). When you visit a map page created by another Wikistreets user, that page may collect more information than we do and may provide information to third parties that we have no relationship with. We request you use discretion when sharing personal information on map pages created by other users, in addition to the discretion you should use when posting content to your own public maps pages. 
</p>

<p>
This Policy also does not apply to websites or services you might access through links or other features (e.g., YouTube videos, Twitter buttons) on the Service. These other services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them before providing them with personal information. 
</p>

<h3>Information You Give Us</h3>

<p>
We may ask for and collect the following personal information about you when you use the Service. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, for our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service, and to allow us to comply with our legal obligations. Without it, we may not be able to provide the Service as intended. 
</p>

<h4>Account and Profile Information</h4>
<p>
When you create an account on a Wikistreets Service (an "Account"), we require you to provide us information such as your username, password, and email address. This information is used for confirming your identity and providing access to the Service. 
</p>

<p>
As a user with a Wikistreets account, you will have a publicly accessible profile where your username will be visible, as well as other content you post to the Site. We do not expose your email address to the public. 
</p>

<h4>Contact Information</h4>
<p>
When you contact us via channels such as chat and email, you may be provide us, in addition to the content of your message, your name and email address. When you contact us for support or feedback, your information is used solely to respond to your request. We do not use your information for marketing.

<h4>Information About Your Accounts on Third-Party Services</h4>
<p>
Wikistreets may provide the ability to log in to the Service using your Google, Facebook, or Microsoft account. If you authenticate yourself using any of these services, you grant us access to your email address, and, if available, your name, photo, and username associated with them. We do not receive your password. 

<h4>Information Posted on Wikistreetss (User content)</h4>
<p>
Users can create map where they and other users can contribute, i.e., post content. This content ("user content") may include text, images, videos, audio, documents, files, links from the web, drawings, and maps. 
</p>

<p>
The administrators of a map (the initial creator and other users appointed as such by the creator) can choose who may contribute and administer a map. 
</p>

<p>
All maps are public on the Internet.  If you are contributing to a map, we advise you to exercise caution when sharing personal information. While we do intend to provide more privacy options in the future, all administrators of a map will be able to change its privacy at any time; a map you thought was private today may become totally public tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
Public maps give us, Wikistreets, the right to view, share, and promote the content on them.
</p>

<h4>Precise Location Information</h4>
<p>
We let users easily create and post content to maps. When creating a map, users can choose to associate content with their current location. Should a user choose to do so, we may request a one-time access to the user’s precise location (within the accuracy limitations that the user's device affords). The location is used only while the user has enabled this feature for this purpose. We do not store or track your device location on an ongoing basis. 

<h3>Information We Track Automatically</h3>

<p>
When you use the Service, we may automatically collect information, including personal information, about you and how you use the Service. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, to enable us to comply with legal obligations and given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service. 
</p>

<p>
If you use Wikistreets on different devices, we may associate and combine the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent service across your different devices. If we do combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Policy. 
</p>

<h4>Information Collected Using Cookies</h4>
<p>
Cookies are data that a website can store on a user’s web browser for a duration of time. Every website stores its own set of cookies and, by design, one website cannot read the cookies of another website. 
</p>

<p>
Wikistreets’s cookies are used to: 
<ul>
<li>authenticate users </li>
<li>keep users logged in while they use the Service </li>
<li>track behavior on the Service (e.g. which page the user visited after the home page) </li>
<li>remember user preferences (e.g. default location for new maps)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When you share links to external services on Wikistreets, e.g. YouTube, those services may store cookies on your browser too. We have no control over the cookies they store and what they do with them. 
</p>

<h4>Information Related to Your Device</h4>
<p>
We may collect device-specific information such as:
<ul>
<li>device brand, version, and type (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S9 Cellphone) </li>
<li>operating system and version (e.g. Android 8.0) </li>
<li>browser type and version (e.g. Chrome 63.0) </li>
<li>screen size and resolution (e.g. 375px wide retina screen) </li>
<li>battery and signal strength (e.g. 15% battery, 75% signal strength)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve Wikistreets for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you’ve opted in to receive them. 
</p>

<h4>Information Related to the Use of the Service</h4>
<p>
We collect information about how people use the Service. This information includes general usage information, and may include information such as the number and frequency of our visitors, which pages or features of the Service they have visited, which links on the Service they have clicked on, and the length of those visits. 
</p>

<p>
We may also use third party applications and services, such as Google Analytics (GA), to collect, analyze, and report this information. We may also use some of this information in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure related to all of our users that would not identify you personally. 
</p>

<p>
We use information about your use of the Service to improve and enhance your experience on the Service. 
</p>

<h4>Information Related to Your Location </h4>
<p>
An IP address is an address assigned to any device connected to the Internet. Depending on where you are, your IP address can be unique to your computer, or shared among many devices. An IP address can be used to locate the device it is assigned to, and in turn the user using it. 
</p>

<p>
When you use the Service, we collect your IP address for: 
<ul>
<li>personalization (e.g. showing Portuguese site to Brazilian users) 
<li>analytics (e.g. how many people from France used Wikistreets today) 
<li>detecting and preventing spam and malware (e.g. blocking the IP addresses posting bad links) 
<li>troubleshooting issues with our Service (e.g. if users in Chicago are seeing more errors than users in New York, we should investigate our Chicago servers) 
</ul>

<p>
We do not store your IP address anywhere on our service for longer than 30 days after your visit. We may use Google Analytics’ IP anonymization feature to prevent them from associating your activity with your identity. (So, GA will only see that someone in San Francisco visited page X, not someone who lives on the corner of 6th St and Mission St.) 
</p>

<h4>Information Related to Your Search History </h4>
<p>
We track your search queries on the Service to learn your preferences and improve your search results over time. 
</p>

<h4>Information received from third-party sources </h4>
<p>
We may also obtain information, including personal information, from third-party sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically. This may include aggregated anonymous information or certain personal information that may be provided to us. If we receive personal information from third-parties, we will handle it in accordance with this Policy. If we directly combine information we receive from other third-parties with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information and handle it in accordance with this Policy.
</p>

<p>
Local law may require you authorize the third-party to share your information with us before we can acquire it. We do not control, supervise, or respond to how third parties providing your information process your personal information, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third-parties.  
</p>

<h3>How Long We Retain Information</h3>

<p>
Wikistreets will keep information for as long as necessary to provide the Service under our <a href="/static/legalese/terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a> and other relevant agreements between you and Wikistreets. We will also retain information so as to fulfil any legal requirement to which we are subject to, e.g. trade, tax, and employment law. We will discard personal information when: 
<ul>
<li>the data subject withdraws consent to processing, 
<li>our contractual obligations have been fully performed and cannot be performed to any further extent, or
<li>the personal information is obsolete. 
</ul>
</p>

<p>
We will also not keep any information the processing of which has been objected to, or for which a request for erasure has been made, beyond the legally required timeframe to complete such a request (usually 30 days). 
</p>

<h3>Whom Do We Share the Collected Information With?</h3>

<p>
First and foremost, you should know that Wikistreets does not sell or rent your personal information to any third-party for any purpose. 
</p>

<p>
We share information we collect from you under the limited circumstances set forth below: 
</p>

<h4>Information Shared With the Public Through the Service</h4>
<p>
All maps are publicly accessible. Users may choose to post personally identifying information to maps, including the user’s photo, name, username, bio, home addreess, work address, family members' details and photos, and links to other personally identifying documents.
</p>

<p>
This content is accessible to and searchable by all Wikistreets users. Any content you post on a map is also indexable by search engines and, as such, is open to the public.  Please be careful what you post.
</p>

<h4>Information Shared With Other Wikistreets Users Through the Service</h4>
<p>
When you collaborate with other people, they can see your username and any other details you choose to share with them.
</p>

<h4>Information Shared With Service Providers in Order to Operate and Improve the Services</h4>
<p>
We may work with many vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf. These service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions. 
</p>

<p>
These providers have limited access to your personal information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually bound to protect and use it only for the purpose for which it was disclosed and consistent with this Policy. 
</p>

<h4>Information Shared with Third Parties</h4>
<p>
We may share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other de-identified or non-personally identifiable information, with users, partners, press, or other third-parties in order to, for example, demonstrate how Wikistreets is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for Wikistreets. Any aggregated information and non-personalized information shared this way will not contain any personal information. 
</p>

<h4>Information Disclosed to Fulfil Legal Obligations </h4>
<p>
We may disclose personal information if necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process. We may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Wikistreets, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our Terms of Service or other agreements. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to law enforcement and government requests. 
</p>

<p>
Where appropriate, we may notify users about the legal requests, unless (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law; (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon Wikistreets, or its users. In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so. 
</p>

<h4>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers </h4>
<p>
Over time, Wikistreets may grow and reorganize. We may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Policy. 
</p>

<p>
In the event that all or a portion of Wikistreets or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third-party, personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third-party. This Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this Policy (unless you give consent to a new policy). We will provide you with notice of an acquisition within 30 days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by emailing you on your email address on file. If you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, you may request its deletion from the company. 
</p>

<p>
In the unlikely event that Wikistreets goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy, we will protect your personal information, and will not sell it to any third-party. 
</p>

<h4>Information Shared to Enforce Content Policy </h4>
<p>
To make sure that all content on Wikistreets conforms to our content policy, we may run user content, no matter the privacy, through a series of automated checks. If any content is flagged to be in violation of our content policy, an authorized personnel at Wikistreets may look at it to determine the appropriate action to be taken against that content. This helps us keep the Service safe and appropriate for all users. 
</p>

<h4>Information You Share with Third Party Services</h4>
<p>
You may access Third Party Services through the Service, for example by watching a YouTube video on a map. You may also choose to share information that you provide to us with Third Party Services (e.g., by posting your map to Twitter or Facebook). These services have their own privacy policies which we don’t govern. We encourage you to review them before providing them with personal information. 
</p>

<h4>Information Shared With Your Consent or at Your Request </h4>
<p>
Other than the cases above, we will share your information only if we have your consent. 

<h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. In case of major changes, we will notify users by email addresses provided to us. 
</p>

<p>
If you don’t agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may terminate your account. By continuing to use the Service after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to the current version of the Privacy Policy. 
</p>
