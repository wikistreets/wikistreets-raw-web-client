        <p>
          As a global platform for creativity and self-expression, Wikistreets
          is deeply committed to supporting and protecting freedom of speech. At
          the same time, we draw lines around a few narrowly-defined but deeply
          important categories of content and behavior that jeopardize our
          users, threaten our infrastructure, or damage our community.
        </p>

        <h2>What Wikistreets is for:</h2>
        <p>
          Wikistreets celebrates creativity, knowledge, and experience. We want
          you to express yourself freely and use Wikistreets to reflect who you
          are, and what you love, think, witness, do, know, and believe.
        </p>

        <h2>What Wikistreets is not for:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Malicious Bigotry. Don't actively promote violence or extreme hatred
            against individuals or groups, on the basis of race, ethnic origin,
            religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual
            orientation. While we firmly believe that the best response to
            hateful speech is not censorship but more speech, we will take down
            malicious bigotry, as defined here.
          </li>
          <li>
            Harm to Minors. Be thoughtful when posting anything involving a
            minor. Examples of content you shouldn't post:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Child sexual abuse: Don't post any content that depicts or
                promotes child sexual abuse.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pedophilia: Don't post content that encourages or promotes
                sexual attraction towards children. For example, do not create
                maps with images or video of children where the collection of
                images or text accompanying the images is sexually suggestive.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bullying: Don't bully minors, even if you are one. Life as a
                teenager is hard enough without the fear, anguish, and isolation
                caused by online bullying.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Promotion and Glorification of Self-Harm. Don't post content that
            actively promotes or glorifies self-harm. This includes content that
            urges or encourages readers to cut or injure themselves; embrace
            anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders; or commit suicide
            rather than, e.g., seeking counseling or treatment, or joining
            together in supportive conversation with those suffering or
            recovering from depression or other conditions. Dialogue about these
            behaviors is incredibly important and online communities can be
            extraordinarily helpful to people struggling with these difficult
            conditions. We aim to sustain Wikistreets as a place that
            facilitates awareness, support and recovery, and to remove only
            those blogs that cross the line into active promotion or
            glorification of self-harm.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gore and Mutilation Content. Don't post gore just to be shocking.
            Don't showcase the mutilation or torture of human beings, animals,
            or their remains.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sexually Explicit Content. Don't post pornography. Period. The line
            between pornography and art can be blur sometimes, or even differ
            from culture to culture. A good check is to ask yourself - "Would I
            post this on my public Facebook feed?" If you wouldn't, don't put it
            on Wikistreets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Username and Map Title Abuse. Wikistreets's usernames and map titles
            are for the use and enjoyment of our users. Don't squat, hoard,
            collect, trade, or sell Wikistreets usernames or map titles, and
            don't register a username or map title for the purpose of
            impersonating an individual, organization, or brand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spam. Don't abuse social gestures, and post unwanted messages or
            media. Don't put deceptive links or dubious code in your posts. That
            includes using Javascript to inject unwanted ads in blogs, or
            embedding links to interstitial or pop-up ad services. Don't use
            deceptive means to generate revenue or traffic, or create
            Wikistreetss with the primary purpose of affiliate marketing. Spam
            doesn't belong on Wikistreets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mass Registration and Automation. Don't register accounts or post
            content automatically, systematically, or programmatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            Copyright and Trademark Infringement. Respect the copyrights and
            trademarks of others. If you aren't authorized to use someone else's
            copyrighted or trademarked work (either expressly or by legal
            exceptions and limitations like fair use), don't. It is our policy
            to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement as per our
            Terms of Service and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
          </li>
          <li>
            Impersonation, Stalking, or Harassment. Treat the community the way
            you'd like to be treated. If you want to parody or ridicule a public
            figure (and who doesn't?), don't try to trick readers into thinking
            you are actually that public figure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Privacy Violations. Don't use Wikistreets to deceptively obtain
            personal information. Don't post content that violates anyone's
            privacy, including personally identifying or confidential
            information like credit card numbers, social security numbers,
            unlisted contact information, or private photos of your ex's junk
            (no matter how attractive).
          </li>
          <li>
            Disruptions, Exploits, and Resource Abuse. Our servers and the
            valiant engineers who support them work hard for you. Don't attempt
            unauthorized use, disruption, or exploitation of Wikistreets.com or
            our other products and services, or otherwise abuse Wikistreets's
            resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlawful Uses and Content. This one's pretty obvious, but
            Wikistreets is not a place for illegal behavior, including fraud,
            phishing, or illegally inciting violence.
          </li>
        </ul>
